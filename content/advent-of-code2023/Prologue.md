## Prologue - How I'll approach this Advent of CoC

Ignoring the incredible levels of immaturity with a title like this, the purpose of this series is to
document my reasoning and thoughts on this year's code advent, explaining why I've approached something or
how I may or may not dislike a question. I'm intending on doing this using **C#**, and more specifically
a C# console app.

In light of that, my intention is to treat this also as a sort of personal tutorial.

## Why I'm doing this

For the most part, my intention with participating is to practice. I'm not interested in actually being on the leaderboard or anything like that, so I can focus more on figuring out how I want to approach each problem rather than attempting to get it done faster than other individuals.
