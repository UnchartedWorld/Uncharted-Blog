# Hi, welcome to my blog,

The purpose of this is to serve as a host of my personal collection of university materials that I wished to host online for whatever reason I felt at the time - either for posterity, or simply to make access from other devices far easier.

As time progresses, the intention is to eventually have small tutorials for stuff I encounter that I felt may be useful for others, and the occasional discussion of topics that may or may not interest me.

Hopefully you'll find much of what you see here as interesting, and if so, thank you! I appreciate it a lot.
